# TweetBot
A bot that automatically posts random questions / tweets to twitter via the Twitter API.


1) You have to create a folder called "stuff".
2) There you have to create a new file called "config.js"
3) Inside "conifg.js" you have to place your account credentials for your twitter-dev account:

-> Make file "config.js" like so:
(HIDE THIS FILE WHEN UPLOADING TO GITHUB etc. !!!)

// Account info:
module.exports = {
    consumer_key:           '...',
    consumer_secret:        '...',
    access_token:           '...',
    access_token_secret:    '...'
}

4) Ready!!
